    <h1>Que:- Why should background and color be used as separate properties?</h1>
    <u>Ans:-</u>
    <div>
        There are two reasons behind this:
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>
            It enhances the legibility of style sheets.
            <br> The background property is a complex property in CSS, and if it is combined with color, the complexity
            will further increase.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Color is an inherited property while the background is not.
            <br>
            So this can make confusion further.
        </li>
    </ul>
