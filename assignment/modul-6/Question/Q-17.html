        <p>Inner HTML is slow It is very slow because as inner HTML already parses the content even we have to parse the
            content again so that's why it takes time.</p>
        <p>When we have used the event handlers then the event handlers are not automatically attached to the new
            elements created by innerHTML.</p>
        <p>Either you add, append, delete or modify contents on a webpage using innerHTML, all contents is replaced,
            also all the DOM nodes inside that element are reparsed and recreated.</p>
        <p>
            Usually, += is used for appending in JavaScript. But on appending to an Html tag using innerHTML, the whole
            tag is re-parsed.
        </p>
        <p>Even broken HTML can be used, which may lead to unexpected problems.</p>
