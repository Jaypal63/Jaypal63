        <p>&#10233 The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.</p>
        <p>&#10233jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library. </p>
        <p>&#10233 jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and
            wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.</p>
        <p>&#10233 At its core, jQuery is used to connect with HTML elements in the browser via the DOM. </p>
        <p>&#10233jQuery is used by 94.4% of all the websites whose JavaScript library we know. This is 77.3% of all websites.</p>
