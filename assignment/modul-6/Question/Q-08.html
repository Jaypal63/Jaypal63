    <div>
        <p> (===) operator is  one type of comparison operator which is called "strict operator"</p>
        <p>The strict equality ( === ) operator checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result</p>
        <p>Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality operator always considers operands of different types to be different.</p>
        <p>this operator performs type casting for equality</p>
        <u> Example:-</u>
        <pre>
            <li>7 === 7 (true)</li>
            <li>'7' === 7 (False)</li>
        </pre>
